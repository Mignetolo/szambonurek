Sure, here's a short README that you can use on GitHub for your packet analysis script:

Packet Analysis Tool
Overview
This script is a simple packet analysis tool that processes network capture files (e.g., pcap) using the PyShark library. It extracts information from packets, identifies matches based on predefined regular expressions, and generates a summary report in an Excel workbook.

Features
Packet Data Extraction: Extracts relevant information from each packet, including packet number, timestamp, length, and transport layer details.

Regular Expression Matching: Uses predefined regular expressions to identify matches of different types such as IPv4, IPv6, email addresses, and domain names within packet data.

Summary Report: Generates a summary report in an Excel workbook, detailing the count and packet numbers for each identified match type.

File Hash Calculation: Calculates the SHA256 hash of the input capture file for integrity verification.

Usage
Install the required Python libraries:

Copy code
pip install pyshark openpyxl
Run the script:

css
Copy code
python packet_analysis.py -i input_file.pcap
Check the generated Excel workbook (output_file_output.xlsx) for packet data and summary information.

Example
python
Copy code
# Example command-line usage
python packet_analysis.py -i input_file.pcap
Dependencies
PyShark: Python wrapper for Tshark, allowing packet parsing using Wireshark dissectors.

openpyxl: A Python library for reading and writing Excel files.
